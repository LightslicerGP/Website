        Hello! I own a YouTube channel, named LightslicerGP. I love to play racing games (such as Forza Horizon 3) and my favorite game is obviously Minecraft. I have both Bedrock and Java edition. I also know and love to solve Rubik's cubes. My personal best is 11.32 seconds and my average is 25 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have made some Minecraft creations in the past including my most proud creation, SimplyCubed. I have also made a skin pack and a survival world named SimplySkin and SimplySurvival. They are all in a pack called SimplyCraft (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        My YouTube channel includes tutorials, comparisons, unboxings, reviews, gameplay, and other entertainment that anyone can watch.

        People have questioned what and why my logo is the way it is, and there is a double meaning. The first meaning is when you follow the color scheme. My top 4 favorite colors are in this order: blue, green, red, and yellow. When you follow this order of the letters you get LSGP which stands for Lightslicer Gaming and Puzzles. The second meaning is when you read it normally, LSPG. Now I always have said that my channel is family-friendly, and this is where the second meaning comes into play. The PG from LSPG means the PG rating and/or below for my videos.
