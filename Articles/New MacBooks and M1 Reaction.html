        Now what happened in the event?
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you don't already know, the macbooks released from around a year ago was included with their own new M1 chip which had amazing performace on a laptop. Youtubers such as MKBHD and Dave2d were very impressed with what they had and what performance it gave in a laptop.

      <p>
        The new M1 Max and M1 Pro come with better performance on both the cpu side and gpu side. Im focusing mainly on the gpu side, since you know... im a g a m e r and need more fps to play games. The new Macbook Pros come with a 120hrtz ProMotion display which is even better for gamers. Macbooks (and apple laptop/pc's in general) are known as not good for gaming on, but with a better gpu performance it could possibly be better.
